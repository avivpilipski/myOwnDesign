# TechSpec for National Parks Game

## Tech Stack

**#1 Unreal Engine with Pixel Streaming**
Unreal engine is a seasoned game engine, and supports the web as a target via Pixel Streaming.
Pros:
Ray tracing graphics.
You can hire Unreal Engine developers!
Battle tested and well documented.
Cons:
You need to pay for a server to run the game :(
You need to code in c++
Contenders:
Unity (with WebGL Export), Three.js, Babylon.js:

- Unity runs into performance issues for a game of this scale in the browser
- Three.js is awesome for graphics, but it doesn't give you a visual way to build scenes, and lacks global illumination (that can be baked into unity games)
- Babylon.js is ugly and also doesn't have a viewport. It's documentation is ugly too.
