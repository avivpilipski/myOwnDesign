## Features
### Placing plants, animals, and basic features like rocks on map (P0)

### Animals move around (P0)
### Placing hills and valleys on map (P2)
- IDK how that would even affect anything.
### Placing rivers and lakes on map (P1)
### Animals breeding (P1)
- May include animal genders. May require that both animals be fed.
### Plants growing over time(P2)
### Natural disasters (P1)
### 3D view (P2)
- This won't happen. It's getting simplified to 2D.
### Seasons changing (P2)
### day/night cycle (P2)
### Animal-specific variables (P2)
- There's like 30 different variables for each animal. Stuff like "tree climbing skill", "antler growth level", and "sun exposure tolerance. None of that is gonna happen. We'll have predators and prey, and male and female. If there's time, we'll have hunger level too, and you'll only be able to mate if you have enough food in your belly.
