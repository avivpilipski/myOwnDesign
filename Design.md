# Build Your Own National Park - Web Game

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to empower users to build a virtual experience of their wildest dreams. This app, once developed, will allow those who have a profound appreciation for nature to channel their hopes and dreams into a digital world of their own creation. This game fills an industry gap for plant and animal lovers through three distinct ways:

- **Creation of a 3rd Space**: Psychologists have noted the lack of third spaces—communal, undigitized multiplicities—in modern society. This app provides an accessible digital third space.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Users will build interactive national parks and navigate challenges such as natural disasters (wildfires, typhoons, etc.) and weather-related obstacles.
- **Life-long Learning**: Users must carefully curate their parks to ensure their success and growth. The game will include gamified awards for features like biodiversity, upkeep, and environmental efforts.

## Aesthetics

This will be a 3D experience featuring elements of a national park such as animals, plants, changing topography, time, weather, and timeline.

### Natural Landscapes

- **Dynamic Terrain**: Users can customize topography with hills, valleys, rivers, and lakes. Elevation, water flow, and landforms can be manipulated to design unique parks.
- **Seasonal Changes**: The environment will change with the seasons, showcasing vibrant autumn leaves, winter snow, spring blooms, and summer greenery.
- The seasons will change as akin to the Earth - rotating between fall, winter, spring summer.
- There is also a day-night cycle that the player will not be able to change: it will align with the player's time zone!

### Flora and Fauna

- **Diverse Plant Life**: Include various 3D models of trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses. Rare species can be offered as achievement rewards.
- **Wildlife Models**: Realistic 3D animals (e.g., bears, deer, birds) that interact with the park environment. Users can attract specific wildlife by planting certain flora.
- The purpose of implementing animals is not only to motivate the user to tend to them and create a diverse, flourishing, and biodiverse natural park, but also has the simultaneous purpose of attracting visitors.

### Interactive Features

- **Weather Effects**: Real-time weather changes, such as rain, snow, fog, and sunlight. Certain plants may thrive in specific weather conditions.
- **Natural Disasters**: Simulations of wildfires, floods, and storms that users must strategize around to protect their parks.
- There is no way to prevent the occurrence of these natural disasters much as on Earth. Buildings, however, can be optimized using technology and reinforcement techniques to help safeguard against these events.
- Further, there is no way to "lose" the game. If a natural disasters sweeps through your forest and wreaks havoc, you will do you as all the humans have done before you: Persevere.

### User-Created Structures

- **Campgrounds and Facilities**: Users can build campsites, picnic areas, educational centers, and observation decks, enhancing the park’s attractiveness.
- **Eco-Friendly Structures**: Options for green buildings (e.g., solar panels, rainwater collection) that blend seamlessly with the natural surroundings.

## Gamification Elements

- **Achievement Badges**: Earn visually appealing badges or trophies for accomplishments like creating balanced ecosystems or saving endangered species.
- **Interactive Quests**: Tasks that guide users through park exploration and conservation efforts, adding a lifelong learning component.
- THIS IS A SANDBOX GAME - the player can get infinite resources to start their national park EXCEPT animals cannot be created on command - they must be bred and crossed carefully to ensure park vitality.
- The player navigates the game from a birds-eye view, everything is developed and viewed from above.
- YOU are the main character in the game, and you get to choose your appearance and outfit before starting to build your park.

## Artistic Style

- **Vibrant Colors**: A bright, inviting color palette to evoke a sense of wonder and positivity.
- **Stylized Graphics**: A semi-realistic art style balancing realism with a playful, whimsical feel.

## Sound and Music

- **Ambient Soundscapes**: 3D audio that includes rustling leaves, flowing water, animal calls, and gentle winds to immerse users.
- **Thematic Music**: Soothing background music that changes with the time of day or weather to enhance the user's emotional connection to their park.

## User Interface (UI)

- **Intuitive Design**: A UI that blends seamlessly with the 3D world, using natural elements like leaves or stones for buttons and menus.
- **Tutorial Elements**: Integrated tutorial prompts to guide users through the building process, making it accessible for all skill levels.
