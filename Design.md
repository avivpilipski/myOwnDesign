# Build Your Own National Park - Web Game

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to empower users to build a virtual experience of their wildest dreams. This app, once developed, will allow those who have a profound appreciation for nature to channel their hopes and dreams into a digital world of their own creation. This game fills an industry gap for plant and animal lovers through three distinct ways:

- **Creation of a 3rd Space**: Psychologists have noted the lack of third spaces—communal, undigitized multiplicities—in modern society. This app provides an accessible digital third space.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Users will build interactive national parks and navigate challenges such as natural disasters (wildfires, typhoons, etc.) and weather-related obstacles.
- **Life-long Learning**: Users must carefully curate their parks to ensure their success and growth. The game will include gamified awards for features like biodiversity, upkeep, and environmental efforts.

## Aesthetics
This will be a 3D experience featuring elements of a national park such as animals, plants, changing topography, time, weather, and timeline.

### Natural Landscapes
- **Dynamic Terrain**: Users can customize topography with hills, valleys, rivers, and lakes. Elevation, water flow, and landforms can be manipulated to design unique parks.
- **Seasonal Changes**: The environment will change with the seasons, showcasing vibrant autumn leaves, winter snow, spring blooms, and summer greenery.
